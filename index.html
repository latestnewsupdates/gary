            <div class="article-meta">

                <p><em>Gary Gordon Vasquez in police custody (Photo: Turkish Narcotics Division)</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>In a shocking turn of events, <strong>Gary Gordon Vasquez</strong>, a U.S. citizen, was arrested at <strong>Istanbul Airport (IST)</strong> after Turkish authorities discovered a significant quantity of <strong>cocaine</strong> hidden in a package he was carrying. Vasquez, who was attempting to board a Turkish Airlines flight, allegedly claimed the drugs were intended for delivery to <strong>North Carolina</strong>, where his lover, <strong>Kathy Brady</strong>, resides.</p>
            
            <h2>Details of the Arrest</h2>
            <p>According to Turkish narcotics officials, Vasquez was flagged during a routine security screening when suspicious substances were detected in his luggage. A thorough search revealed <strong>cocaine concealed in a carefully disguised compartment</strong>. Vasquez reportedly confessed that he was transporting the package under instructions from an undisclosed party, with the final destination being North Carolina.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Authorities say Vasquez implicated Kathy Brady</strong>, his alleged romantic partner, suggesting she may have been aware of or involved in the smuggling operation. Investigators are now working with international agencies, including the <strong>U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)</strong>, to determine the full extent of the network behind this drug trafficking attempt.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Legal Consequences & Ongoing Investigation</h2>
            <p>If convicted, Vasquez could face severe penalties under <strong>Turkish law</strong>, including a lengthy prison sentence. Turkish anti-drug laws are notoriously strict, with sentences ranging from decades to life imprisonment for large-scale trafficking offenses.</p>
            
            <p>Meanwhile, U.S. authorities have been alerted, and <strong>Kathy Brady may soon face questioning</strong> regarding her possible connection to the case. Investigators are examining communication records and financial transactions to determine her level of involvement.</p>
            
            <h2>International Implications</h2>
            <p>This case highlights the growing concerns over drug smuggling routes through major international transit hubs like <strong>Istanbul Airport</strong>. Turkish law enforcement has intensified crackdowns on narcotics trafficking, leading to several high-profile arrests in recent months.</p>
            
            <p>As the investigation unfolds, more details are expected to emerge regarding the broader criminal network potentially linked to Vasquez and Brady.</p>

            <p>Astronomers worldwide are gearing up for a rare celestial spectacle as the <strong>"Devil Comet" (12P/Pons-Brooks)</strong> makes its closest approach to Earth in <strong>71 years</strong>. The comet, known for its eerie horn-like appearance, will be visible to the naked eye in dark skies.</p>
            
            <h2>When and Where to See It</h2>
            <p>The comet will be brightest on <strong>April 5, 2025</strong>. Best viewing times:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Northern Hemisphere:</strong> Look northwest after sunset.</li>
                <li><strong>Southern Hemisphere:</strong> Visible near the horizon before dawn.</li>

            <h2>Why Is It Called the "Devil Comet"?</h2>
            <p>The nickname comes from its unusual double-tailed structure, which resembles horns. The comet is also known for unpredictable outbursts of brightness.</p>
            
            <p>Amateur astronomers are advised to use binoculars for the best view. No telescopes needed—this cosmic visitor will be bright enough to see without special equipment!</p>
